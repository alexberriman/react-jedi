## 🔥 Server-Driven UI on Steroids

React Jedi is a next-generation **npm library** for building visually stunning interfaces through pure JSON specifications. It combines the power of React, TailwindCSS, and ShadCN components to create a streamlined development experience.

> **Note:** This project is currently under active development.

## ✨ Features

- **Zero Lock-in**: Import what you need, integrate with any React app
- **Dynamic JSON-Driven Rendering**: Define entire UIs with pure JSON
- **Single Function API**: Simple `render()` function for all UI needs
- **Real-Time UI Generation**: Create interfaces on-the-fly
- **Nested Components**: Build complex UIs with JSON composition
- **Reactive State**: Manage component state directly in specifications
- **Conditional Rendering**: Implement logic in your JSON schema
- **Event Handling**: Define handlers within your specifications
- **Animation Framework**: Declarative animations for all interactions
- **Theme Inheritance**: Cascading styles through component hierarchy

## 🚀 Installation

Installation instructions will be provided once the package is published.

## 🏄‍♂️ Getting Started

Documentation and examples will be coming soon as development progresses.

## 🌈 Specification Structure

Detailed schema documentation will be provided as development progresses.

## 📚 Documentation

Documentation website coming soon.

## 🔧 TypeScript Support

React Jedi is being built with TypeScript to provide full type safety.

## 🧩 Planned Components

React Jedi will include a comprehensive set of beautiful components based on ShadCN and custom implementations.

## ⚡ Performance Benchmarking

React Jedi includes a built-in performance benchmarking system to ensure components meet strict performance standards:

```bash
# Run all component benchmarks
npm run benchmark

# Run benchmarks with UI for interactive analysis
npm run benchmark:ui

# Generate benchmark report
npm run benchmark:report
```

Performance benchmarks help maintain a fast user experience by:

- Measuring render, update, and unmount times for all components
- Analyzing memory usage and operations per second
- Detecting performance regressions
- Enforcing performance budgets for components

See the [benchmark documentation](src/benchmark/README.md) for more details on creating and running benchmarks.
