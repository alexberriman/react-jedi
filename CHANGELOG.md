- **TASK: Implement comprehensive icon rendering system for SDUI/JSON mode. CRITICAL ISSUE: System-wide problem - many components fall back to emojis instead of rendering proper icons in SDUI mode. This affects Alert, Badge, Breadcrumb, Button, Command, DataTable, NavigationMenu, Resizable, Tabs, Input, ToggleGroup, and potentially others. ROOT CAUSE: The SDUI rendering system cannot process icon components from the JSON specification. IMPACT: Major usability and professional appearance issues across the entire component library. IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION: Emojis (🚀, ⚠️, ✓, etc.) are NOT valid icons. SDUI components MUST be able to render actual SVG icon components just like React mode does. Icons should be proper vector graphics, not emoji characters. ACTION REQUIRED: 1) Design icon component architecture for SDUI (icon library mapping, icon registry, or inline SVG support). 2) Implement icon renderer that can handle common icon libraries (Lucide, Heroicons, etc.). 3) Create icon mapping system to translate icon names/components to renderable SVG elements. 4) Update all affected components to use the new icon system. 5) Remove ALL emoji fallback code throughout the codebase - emojis are NOT acceptable substitutes for icons. 6) Support icon props: size, color, strokeWidth, className. 7) Document the icon system for SDUI usage. 8) Add comprehensive tests for icon rendering. EXPECTED OUTCOME: Full SVG icon support in SDUI mode matching React exactly, with NO emoji fallbacks anywhere in the system. All icons must be proper vector graphics.**

- **TASK: Replace Skeleton component animation with Tailwind pulse. ISSUE: Skeleton elements expand/contract on render making them look broken. Current Framer Motion implementation causes unwanted size changes. SOLUTION: Replace with Tailwind's simple pulse animation utility. ACTION REQUIRED: 1) Remove Framer Motion animation from Skeleton component. 2) Apply Tailwind's 'animate-pulse' class instead. 3) Ensure consistent sizing without expansion effects. 4) Test performance with multiple skeletons. 5) Verify animation works in both React and SDUI modes. REFERENCE: Tailwind pulse animation example - https://i.imgur.com/4CVhL4H.png. EXPECTED OUTCOME: Smooth pulse animation without size changes using Tailwind utilities.**

- **TASK: Update all placeholder images across the entire codebase. ISSUE: Currently using picsum.photos and unsplash.com for placeholder images which may have availability/performance issues. SCOPE: Search ALL story files (*.stories.tsx) throughout the codebase. ACTION REQUIRED: 1) Find all instances of picsum.photos URLs and unsplash.com URLs in story files. 2) Replace each URL with placehold.co format: https://placehold.co/{width}x{height}/EEE/31343C. 3) Preserve the original dimensions from each image URL when replacing. EXAMPLE: Replace 'https://picsum.photos/200/300' with 'https://placehold.co/200x300/EEE/31343C'. EXPECTED OUTCOME: All story files use consistent, reliable placeholder images from placehold.co.**

- **Implement dual-mode Storybook rendering for all UI components, allowing stories to display both native React components and SDUI (JSON-rendered) views with automatic testing of both modes. This ensures complete parity between direct React usage and the SDUI render() function. Each component's stories should be enhanced with the dual-mode decorator and comprehensive play functions that test both rendering modes.** (63 subtasks completed)

- **Theres quite a few components that need a bit of polish, either just the component itself or storybook. You can take multiple of these subtasks simultaneously to help speed up development. For all subtasks, where appropriate, make sure stories are updated, and relevant pages in the showcase examples app (./examples).  Feel free to pick multiple sub tasks at the same time to speed up development.** (48 subtasks completed)
  - The ToggleGroup component default story goes black bg when hover - this looks awful, it should be a lot more subtle (very light grey for example). Textarea, input fields etc. have the WORST grey background on hover - they either shouldn't have any hover background, or should be VERY subtle (i.e. if main bg is white, should hover to bg-gray-50 or something (or whatever that equivalent is). This impacts Textarea, Input, Select. Like honestly, its the worst thing I've ever seen.
  - The Accordion component items go dark grey bg when hover - this looks awful, it should be a lot more subtle (very light grey for example). Also, text kind of jumps - i guessing there is no padding, and then when you hover there is padding, causing text to jump. Honestly, you are so far from the mark on this component. Redo all of the UI to make it way sexier, way more 🔥 (while still being really clean). Use framer motion/animations/transition etc. to make it all really, really nice.
  - Can you animate the transition of the Switch component. Make it optional as a prop (default to animate, but have a prop to disable animation). Update the storybook page.
  - When I click the Select box and the dropdown comes down, the main Select box 'flickers'. It goes invisible, visible, moves, etc. Please take a look and make sure it doesnt flicker or whatever and is very clean and functional. This also affects the ComboBox component.
  - The RadioGroup options should have cursor-pointer on hover. ALso, when I hover over a RadioGroup option, the 'circle' element disappears for some reason. Both of these issues also impact the CheckBox component.
  - The Masonry component has a 'Pinterest Gallery' story/variant. When you hover over, the image kind of zooms, text appears, etc. It just 'appears' and looks weird - this should all transition in smoothly with framer motion.
  - Why, in the Grid component storybooks, are most of the boxes fading in and out? Remove this
  - The Form component storybook has a With Initial Errors story. I dont actually see any errors in this variant/state. Can you investigate and confirm whether its a storybook issue or component issue. If component issue, fix it.
  - The following component stories contain images that 404. Can you update with images from Picsum (if photo) or placehold.co (if not photo). You can see examples from other component storybooks: Box ('Box With Backdrop Blur')
  - When I first load the Tooltip stories, all of the buttons (Hover me) 'flicker' - theyre visible, then go invisible and back to visible. Please fix. Also - when I hover, I dont see the tooltip. This component seems REALLY buggy, please investigate and fix.
  - When I first load the DropdownMenu stories, all of the buttons (Open Menu) 'flicker' - theyre visible, then go invisible and back to visible. Please fix.
  - When I first load the Drawer stories, all of the buttons (Open Drawer) 'flicker' - theyre visible, then go invisible and back to visible. Please fix.
  - When I first load the Dialog stories, all of the buttons (Open Dialog) 'flicker' - theyre visible, then go invisible and back to visible. Please fix.
  - When I first load the AlertDialog stories, all of the buttons (Show Dialog) 'flicker' - theyre visible, then go invisible and back to visible. Please fix.
  - When I first load the Dialog stories, all of the buttons (Pick a date) 'flicker' - theyre visible, then go invisible and back to visible. Please fix.
  - When I first load the Collapsible stories, all of the buttons (Toggle Content) 'flicker' - theyre visible, then go invisible and back to visible. Please fix. Theres also a weird flicker effect when content appears and disappears
  - Im not sure whaats going on with the Toast component, but when I click the buttons on storybook, the toasts show up, but they either have no bg, or z-index is messed up or something, as the button is over it or visible or something. Please invvestigate and fix.
  - Can you update the tabs component to 'animate' between tab transitions (both the tabs and the content). Add a prop to disable this, but enable by default (make sure to update storybook). Can you also update the UI of tabs component to make it look a lot more modern and nicer visually? (while still being really clean, simple and sexy)
  - The UI of the table component absolutely blows. Can you completely update the UI of the Table component to make it look way nicer, sexier (while still being really clean and modern). Feel free to add multiple style variants. Make sure to update storybook with all variants and the showcase page in the example app (./examples).
  - The following component storybooks dont have a 'Docs' story (all of them should): SkeletonLoader, Loading
  - We define basic components like buttons as Components and more advanced components (like TeamGrid) as Blocks. Currently, Sidebar is in the components dir and classified as a component. Can you move this code to the blocks dir, update the storybook to be in the Blocks category, and move it from the Components showcase (in example app ./examples) to the blocks components showcase in the example app?
  - When I first load the Sheet stories, all of the buttons (Open Sheet) 'flicker' - theyre visible, then go invisible and back to visible. Please fix. Also - the sheet should animate/transition out (framer motion?) rather than just 'appear'. It looks awful. Also - the Sheet title/subtitle? is padded (good), but the sheet content isnt (bad). Please fix. 
  - I can't see some of the Progress stories - not sure why. Please investigate and fix: Default, Empty, Quarter, Half, Three Quarters, Complete. I can see all of the rest
  - When I click the buttons on the Popover storybook page, the button flickers into and out of existence (and kind of moves). Not sure why - fix.
  - Increase the height of all of the NavigationMenu storybook containers (manually set them to 600px or something). I cant see the dropdown menues. Also, when you hover over a menu item in the NavigationMenu, I DONT want it to be underlined. Also - when an item has a dropdown, there is again that really fucking annoying flicker where it goes visible and then not visible, and the fucking text is WHITE ON A GREY BACKGROUND - CANT READ IT. This component needs to be restyled to be a lot sexier, cleaner, more modern and brandable.
  - I don't know what this MenuBar component is, but it sucks. Remove it, stories, remove it from the examples app, component map, docs, etc. Get rid of it.
  - The Markdown component looks REALLY nice. FOr some reason though, there is a 'grey' border or somerthing around the code example? The code examples look sick, not sure why there is that gray border around them.
  - I don't know whats going on, but when I hover over the KeyboardNavigationMenu component the background color goes black for some ridiculous reason.
  - In the Gallery story of the Image component, when I hover over the image there is some sort of zoom effect. It should animate/transition in with something like framer rather than be instant.
  - The Card component has a 'With Zoom Image' story/variant. The zoom should animate/transition in with something like framer, and be a bit slower
  - The Hero component block default stories have this really weird effect on the main title where it kind fades from right to left or something - get rid of it. It looks awful. Otherwise, looks good.
  - Can you redo all of the ui/styles for the StatBlock component? Its way too basic - just text on plain background. Make it more visual, modern, beautiful (but still simple and clean). Maybe add more variants. Update storybook and showcase examples app.
  - The RestaurantMenuBlock component - the default story has categories/filters or something - this isn't centered horizontally (it should) - the container should be 100% width of the parent, and all of the buttons/filters centered horizontally. At the moment it doesn't align with the title/subtitle/search. Also - quite a few images on this page 404. Can you use photos from picsum (see examples in other storybooks).
  - The ProductShowcase component has a lot of really strange flickering going on. Can you investigate and fix. Quite a few images on this page 404 (storybooks) - can you make sure theyre using images from picsum.
  - The line on the ProcessSteps component block don't go all the way (both horizontally and vertically). Please fix - also the UI looks quite.. bleh. Old, dates. Please make it a lot sexier (still clean and simple though).
  - Can you make sure when I hover over a card on the PortfolioCaseStudies component, the image that 'zooms' transitions/animates in with something like framer motion? Can you also slow it down so its quite noticable. Can you make sure the button on this component (View Case Study) has cursor pointer, as do buttons for pagination (on hover etc.). If this is an issue on the Button component - update it there
  - Can you make sure when I hover over an image in the PhotoGallery component, the image that 'zooms' transitions/animates in with something like framer motion? Can you also slow it down so its quite noticable. Also - not sure whats going on, but half the tag isnt visible (its overflowing outside of the container)
  - When you flip the photo flip card, it flips and there is a white background/shadow while its flipping. This kind of ruins the flip effect. Please somehow fix, or use transparent background/no shadow on the container. Some of the images on the storybooks page for this component 404 - please use Picsum (see other component stories for examples).
  - Love this component/block. Can you add another option to configure an 'overlay'? Use case: 'Fullscreen With Background Image' - I would like an overlay (either black or white, default black) where I can control the opacity (default it) to make the text more legible over the image. Make this configurable, update stories and showcase examples page (./examples)
  - I can't see any maps in some of the stories for the Map component (Default, Flat Style, Street Style, Satellite Style, Minimal, With Custom Styling, Single Location Minimal, Event Venue). Theres more actually - please investigate and fix. Also, when scrolling using my mousewheel, and I scroll over a map, it stops and starts zooming in/out the map. I think you can disable this behaviour with leaflet - please do. Also - is it possible to remove the Leaflet/carto copyright? If so, can you do it.
  - Can you make sure when I hover over an image in the Latest News component, the image that 'zooms' transitions/animates in with something like framer motion? Can you also slow it down so its quite noticable.
  - Some images in Header block component stories 404 - can you use placehold.co (see other storybooks for examples). ALso - menu is awful. Hovering over a menu item with dropdown flickers it, its white text on a light gray background, the text is underlined (it shuoldnt be). The buttons on the right should also have cursor-pointer. If these are issues in reusable components, please ensure theyre fixed in the reusable components
  - Can you make sure any element in the FAQ component that is clickable has cursor-pointer (next prev buttons, + symbol etc.). On the carousel variant, there is a really weird pink/red dot or something bottom left (is it meant to be a tag or something, because barely any of it is visible - it overflows outside of the container with hidden overflow)
  - A lot of the images in the EventListings storybook 404 - update all to use picsum
  - Can you make the ErrorPage component look way sexier, and make different variations for different styles of websites (blog, ecommerce platform, magazine, restaurant, etc.)
  - I can't see any images in some of the Carousel component stories. Not sure what the issue is, please investigate. Also please update all iamges to use picsum (see examples elsewhere)
  - Make sure the buttons are centered horizontally in the CallToAction component (the cta buttons Start Free Trial watch demo). The container needs to be 100% width and buttons centered within it.
  - Update the BlogPostDetail component to render markdown (and use our Markdown component we have already built internally). Update storybook and showcase example app (./examples)

For all subtasks, where appropriate, make sure stories are updated, and relevant pages in the showcase examples app (./examples).  Feel free to pick multiple sub tasks at the same time to speed up development.** (29 subtasks completed)
  - The Accordion component looks quite awful. When you hover it goes a dark gray? Is this our theme or default styles. It should look a lot nicer, cleaner, modern. When you hover over one, the text also jumps to the right as though there is a padding change, and has underlined text on hover (shouldnt). When you expand/minimize it jumps around a lot and looks awful, should be a lot smoother using framer. Overall, this component should be a lot nicer, cleaner, modern, beautiful.
  - When I click Show Dialog button on the default story of the AlertDialog component, the button 'flashes' to visible, not visible etc. (button that was used to open it). Looks weird..
  - Can you update the styles/ui of the Alert component to look a lot nicer, cleaner, more modern. It looks a bit dated.
  - The BlockQuote component has a couple of variants where the text is barely legible (its the 3rd and 4th in the variants story). Can you make sure in all variants the text is clearly legible relative to the bg color.
  - For some reason, the Button component are all grouped in a Button directory in storybook. It should be flat like all other components - remove Tests stories.
  - For some reason, when I hover over a Card component in storybook, the title disappears. Its like it transitions to white or something when the bg is white. This shouldn't happen, as you can't read the text. Can you also add a prop for an image in the header (and if an image is passed through, there should be no padding at top of the card). Add some additional props/variants for header image styling, i.e. zoom effects when hovering, image by itself, image with the header text etc. over it (versus underneath) etc. Add more stories.
  - I can't see any of the Charts on the Chart component storybooks. I'm not sure if its an issue with the component, storybook issue (container height?) but not visible.
  - The Command component has a storybook file, but I cant use any of it. When I go there on web, its already up with an overlay, and I Cant dismiss, interact with it, etc. Storybook needs to be setup in schh a way that I can see all of the stories/variants and interface with all of them individually.
  - I can't see any examples of the AnnouncementBar components in storybook - I'm not sure why. Is it a styling conflict? Is there styling on the announcement bar that means its not visible in the box for whatever reason? You can see it here: https://i.imgur.com/GOdVgki.png
  - The BlogPostDetail component looks nice, but the markdown is styled terribly (see: https://i.imgur.com/2f6jU81.png). Are we using the Markdown component we have? Also - above the title in this component there are some tags. Can you make sure these tags are centered horizontally? They're currently left aligned.
  - A lot of cards have images first (BlogPostGrid, BlogPostDetail at the bottom, there's tonnes of them). When there is an image, there is a weird padding at the top. If a card has an image first, there should be no padding at the top of the card. Fix the ones I listed, but also search throughout the codebase for all examples of cards with images and make sure there is no padding at the top of the card in these situations. Its the same for loading states with cards (i.e. BlogPostGrid loading state hover)
  - Quite a lot of images in the example app (./examples) and storybook files use placeholders, however many of them 404. Can you ensure for all images where you want a photo we use picsum.photos (url format is: https://picsum.photos/200/300 where 200 is width and 300 is height), and when you don't want a photo use https://placehold.co/600x600/EEE/31343C (600x600 - first is width second is height). Can you also add a note to `docs/directory-structure.md` to use these images for placeholders.
  - When you over over images on the BlogPostGrid component it 'zooms'. This is a nice effect, but its instant. It should transition/animate smoothly when zooming. Also, when I hover over the BlogPostGrid cards, the title disappears (I assume there is some sort of hover change to title text, maybe it goes to white? Im not sure why it would go to white when the bg is white. I tend to get this hover issue on quite a few cards, so investigate whether its an issue with the Card component itself and, if so, fix it there so it fixes it everywhere.
  - The BrandLogoBar component looks awful. Can you use placeholder images from picsum.photos. When you mouse over, it jumps, etc. looks really awful. This is meant to be the component that is often put under a page hero section, where there is generally either a static list of logos, or scrolling list, common variations inlude grayscale, zoom on hover, sometimes there is a title either above, to left (e.g. Trusted by Top Companies). e.g. https://i.imgur.com/B8kS8Rd.png - can you make sure this component works as expected.
  - The CallToAction component has buttons towards the bottom (i.e. Start Free Trial ->, Watch Demo). These should be centered horizontally in the default state, however they're left aligned for some reason. Looking at the Storybook variants, they should be centered on Default, Centered, With Background Image (already are), Gradient Animated, Bold, With Background Video, With Background Pattern, Custom Gradient, With Custom Shapes, Glass Morphism. It feels like default state should be to center it. On the Newsletter Custom Form variant/story, the input text is gray - barely legible over the blue bg from the parent container
  - The ErrorPage component for the most part looks good. However, it doesnt appear to be centered. It should be 100% of the container width, and everything centered horizontally on the screen.
  - The EventListings component block is pretty good. However, up the top it looks like there is some sort of filter (i.e. I see 'All CategoriesConferenceWorkshopWebinarMeetupNetworking' on the default story). These are just plain text - theyre not functional. If its a filter, implement a filter. Also, the 'Featured Event' variant/story is incredibly too in-your-face. Its all blue. It should be cleaner and more subtle, while still prominent. Make sure all images on this page use picsum.photos (though this may have been implemented by a prior task)
  - The FAQ component is awful. Styles are awful, greys everywhere etc. looks awful. I just want a simple carousel style FAQ component, with a bunch of different variants. Carousel states should smoothly transition and animate etc. Make it simple, clean and sexy.
  - Does the FeatureCard component have icons? For many of the stories I dont see icons (i.e. the Icon Positions story). For the Tabbed Categories variation, the filter styles should be a bit cleaner and nicer looking, and when you go between categories it should animate using framer. In the Icon Focused story/variation, everything is centered except the icon. The icon should be centered in the card
  - In the default FooterBlock (may have been renamed to Footer) block component, when I hover over the social icons, they transition to white (disappear since bg is white). This is a bug. In the 'Standard' variation/story, I assume its dark deliberately (even on light mode). This is fine, but the text 'Building modern React interfaces with JSON specifications' is black and barely legible over the dark background. Same as the 'Get the latest updates on new features and releases' text under the Stay Updated section and the copyright text. Can you confirm the text is legible on all stories and variations.
  - The Header block component has a few bugs: When you hover over a link in the menu (i.e. Docs in the default story), the text should not be underlined. When you hover over a menu item with children items, the text goes white and is barely legible over the light gray background. It also 'jumps' when the dropdown shows. I also can't see the dropdown in the storybook stories as the container is small (height wise). Can you either update the dropdown component to ensure it displays, or inrease the height of the containers in storybook. Can you also confirm the style of the dropdown is fine - even though I can't see it, it looks like there might be some issues i.e. width. Make sure the company logo uses a placeholder image (this may have been fixed in a prior task) in variations with a logo. The FullWidth and CustomGradient stories/variations have links that I can't read - they have a white bg or something which is weird when over the background color and white text. Can you also add a variation (and option/props) with icons or something in the dropdown menu - there should be multiple variations of the dropdown menu, from single vertical list one column stacked, to multi columns, icons, title/icon/desription etc. Needs to be really clean, fresh and modern.
  - In the latest news component there is a With Category Tabs variation/story. Here, the the filter/category styles should be a bit cleaner and nicer looking, and when you go between categories it should animate using framer. When you hover over images in cards, they should zoom with an animation/transition. This may have been implemented prior to this task, but please confirm and, if not, implement.
  - The LocationHours component looks awful - its just a wall of text. I still want clean, simple, sexy UI, but make it look more beautiful - more visual
  - Can you rename the existing Map component to GoogleMap, and then create a new Map component using Leaflet. Make sure you include all of the variations/examples (stories, showcase page in example (./examples) app etc.), and make it look really clean and nice (I like flat style maps, so not the default leaflet). Update other components/blocks that use Map (renaming to GoogleMap) to now use the new Map (leaflet) component
  - Can you ensure the PageHeroHeader component is 100% of the container width and everything is centered horizontally (in the default story). In the 'Fullscreen With Background Image' story, the container height/image is way too big - can you reduce the height. The 'Colorful Background' story looks awful - text is barely legible over background, text and images etc. feel like they should be centered. In all of these examples, unless a variation explicitly should have left aligned text (i.e. two col), all text, headers, buttons etc. should be centered horizontally.
  - Can you update the PageSection component stories to use more examples that are commonly used on websites/marketing websites. Some features: alternating sections (i.e. alternating background color to make them stand out), left/right, more visual variations (i.e. common pattern is image on left/right (alternating), title (h2 default), text underneath, ctas, etc.). Make sure it all looks really nice, storybooks with stories, and update variations/props accordingly (and showcase page).
  - The PhotoFlipCard is a bit strange. It flips to an empty background with a button. It feels like this isnt common pattern. By default, can we 'flip' and have the same image (w/overlay) on the other side as well? I dont know - whatever most modern sites use, we should do that, but flipping to just a white background with button looks awful. Update all images on this page to use placeholder images from picsum.photos (this may have been done in a prior task).
  - When you hover over an image in the PhotoGallery component, it should animate/transition in as it zooms, not happen instantly (this may have been implemented in a prior task, but if it hasnt, implement it). Also - these image cards look a bit poo. There is some weird gray element at the bottom? And half of the tag isn't visible - it goes beyond the container height and is cut off. Also, I'm not sure if there is an issue with the Carousel variation/story implementation, or its just storybook, but I cant see left/right etc. and can't navigate the carousel in storybook. The 'With Actions' variations have a few buttons - these should have cursor pointer.
  - The header in the RestaurantMenuBlock doesn't seem to be 100% width + centered - it looks weird. The Search Menu Items input also should be centered horizontally.

- **We have a large list of components and blocks (advanced components) and theyre all accessible in storybook. However, we need to polish off a few of these components and the storybook configuration. For all subtasks, where appropriate, make sure stories are updated, and relevant pages in the showcase examples app (./examples). Feel free to pick multiple sub tasks at the same time to speed up development.** (2 subtasks completed)
  - Two carousel components for some reason - the one in blocks looks more recent - remove the other implementation, make sure you remove it from the component map and showcase example app as well (./examples). The following components under Components/* in storybook are more advanced components (I'd class them as blocks) - move to be under Blocks in storybook, make sure theyre in the blocks directory, not ui directory, make sure in the showcase example app (./examples) theyre on the Blocks showcase page and not the general Components showcase page: Components/Footer (is this a dupliacte of the FooterBlock? If so, I think FooterBlock is more recent, so remove the old Footer component, rename FooterBlock to footer),  
  - Is it possible to update the icon component storybook (and potentially showcase page in the showcase/example app) to iterate over and display ALL of the icons, and maybe even tooltip with the icon id/name to use to help embed (and potentially even a search). Storybook says there is an IconGallery block (https://storybook.js.org/docs/api/doc-blocks/doc-block-icongallery) with a section to automate icon documentation

  - I want to re-categorize many of the components in storybook. What is currently under 'Blocks' is good (i.e. AnnouncementBar). There are some under Component/Blocks/* that need to be moved to the Blocks category (Carousel, FAQ, Timeline). There are a lot of subcategories under Components - I dont want this Components top level category. I want to move everything under Components/UI/* (i.e. Accordion, Badge) to top level under Components (i.e. Components/Accordion). Everything under Components/Overlay/* (i.e. AlertDialog) should just be under Components, same for Components/Feedback/* (Alert to Components, no Feedback category), Components/Media/* (i.e. AspectRatio), Components/Typography/* (i.e. BlockQuote), Components/Layout/* (i.e. Box) (layout components can go to a new Layout Components category, i.e. 'Layout Components/Box), Components/Navigation/* to Components/*, Components/DataDisplay/* to Components/*, Components/Form/* to Form Components/*, Components/Marketing/* should be moved to Blocks/* (these are advanced components i.e. Blocks), UI/* (i.e. Loading) can just go to Components/*. Move DataFetcher story from Core/* to Utility/* (similar to HeadManager). Same as Library/Data/* (optimistic updates) to Utility/*. Basically I want to flatten everything.
  - A lot of storybook components have a Docs story where I can see them all - this is really good (i.e. look at AnnouncementBar, BlogPostDetail etc.). However, some don't (this is bad) (i.e. Look at ContactForm, ErrorPage). I want you to look at all stories and identify those that don't have a Docs page, and systematically go through and create one.

- **We have a great foundation of core library components (i.e. button etc.) however I want to introduce new, more advanced components (we call 'blocks').

- **Polish and enhancement tasks to improve the core library functionality, particularly around SEO/metadata handling and templating capabilities for the render function.** (3 subtasks completed)
  - Ensure SEO and metadata configuration can be serialized and passed through the render function. Currently the example app shows React component usage, but we need everything to work through JSON specification since APIs send down JSON specs. Tasks: 1) Check if SEO/structured data config is already serializable via render function options, 2) If not, implement serialization support for page titles, meta descriptions, Open Graph tags, Twitter cards, and structured data, 3) Update the /examples/seo-metadata page with clear instructions on how to configure SEO via JSON through render function, 4) Add a new comprehensive SEO documentation page to /documentation section explaining JSON-based SEO configuration with examples.
  - Implement a templating engine to support variables in JSON specifications. Use case: components/blocks can use placeholders like {{currentYear}}, {{companyName}}, {{userEmail}} etc. instead of hardcoding values. Tasks: 1) Research and choose between creating custom engine or using lightweight open-source solution (e.g. mustache, handlebars-lite), 2) Implement variable substitution in render function with support for nested properties, 3) Add reserved/special variables (currentYear, currentDate, timestamp, etc.), 4) Update render function to accept variables parameter, 5) Add comprehensive tests for templating, 6) Update README.md with templating documentation, 7) Create new documentation page at /documentation/templating with examples and variable reference.
  - Create a Markdown component as a core UI component in src/components/ui/. Research and select a lightweight, modern React markdown library (consider: react-markdown, markdown-to-jsx, or similar - prioritize bundle size and active maintenance). Component should: 1) Accept markdown string as input and render formatted content, 2) Support common markdown features (headings, lists, links, code blocks, tables, images), 3) Allow custom component overrides for elements, 4) Support syntax highlighting for code blocks, 5) Be fully typed with TypeScript. Tasks: Create component with proper error handling, add comprehensive Storybook stories showing all markdown features, add to component showcase page, create dedicated showcase page at /showcase/markdown with live editor demo, ensure it works with the render function via JSON specification.

## [2025-06-01]

- **Update README.md with clear instructions on how to import and use the styles when using react-jedi as a third-party dependency. Need to ensure styles are being published to npm and provide documentation on the correct import path and any required setup steps for consuming applications to properly load the CSS styles.**


## [2025-06-01]

- **When publishing to npm and installing in another repo, installation fails with an error about playwright or chromium not being installed. There appears to be a postinstall script that should only run for local development, not for consumers installing the published package. Need to investigate and fix the postinstall script to ensure it doesn't run when the package is installed as a dependency in other projects.**


## [2025-05-31]

- **Fix various UI issues and enhance the example app with better styling, placeholder images, syntax highlighting, search functionality, and other improvements.** (11 subtasks completed)
  - Remove @shadcn/ui text from all cards on the /showcase page in the example app (./examples). Check all component cards and remove any references to @shadcn/ui since React Jedi is its own SDUI library. Update card titles and descriptions to only reference React Jedi components.
  - Update all images in the example app (./examples) to use placeholder images from https://placehold.co service. Replace broken or missing images with URLs like https://placehold.co/600x400/EEE/31343C where 600 is width and 400 is height. Check all pages including showcase pages, component examples, and any other pages with images. Ensure consistent placeholder image sizes appropriate for each context.
  - On the /showcase page in the example app (./examples), some cards only have text like 'Data Table - Advanced sortable table' without actual component examples. Find all such text-only cards and either add proper SDUI component examples to them or create links to their respective showcase pages if they exist. Ensure all cards on /showcase have consistent presentation.
  - Fix the /documentation page header in the example app (./examples) to remove excessive purple and other colors. Make the header consistent with other pages in the app - use the same color scheme, styling, and layout as pages like /showcase or /examples. Ensure clean, professional appearance without random color variations.
  - Fix all nested documentation pages (e.g., /documentation/getting-started) in the example app (./examples). Issues to fix: 1) Remove 100% width that makes content stretch edge-to-edge, 2) Remove random colors like green that don't match the app's design system, 3) Add a proper documentation layout with sidebar navigation, 4) Add previous/next navigation buttons, 5) Ensure consistent styling with main documentation page. Make it look like standard documentation sites.
  - Fix the floating side menu on the /examples page in the example app (./examples). The menu gets cut off by the fixed header. Add proper offset/margin-top to account for the header height so the floating menu is fully visible and doesn't overlap with or get hidden behind the header.
  - Add a syntax highlighting plugin (like Prism.js or highlight.js) to the example app (./examples) for code and JSON examples. Apply syntax highlighting to: 1) Code blocks on the /documentation page, 2) All JSON examples on the /showcase page, 3) All JSON code on individual showcase pages (e.g., /showcase/button, /showcase/group), 4) Any other code snippets throughout the app. Ensure consistent and attractive code formatting.
  - Investigate and confirm that the main @alexberriman/react-jedi library styles are being properly loaded in the example app (./examples). Check: 1) Import statements for library styles, 2) Build configuration, 3) Console for any style loading errors, 4) Verify components are rendering with proper styles from the SDUI library. Fix any issues preventing library styles from loading correctly.
  - Confirm the example app (./examples) is set up to not be indexable by search engines. Check for: 1) robots.txt file with proper disallow rules, 2) Meta tags with noindex/nofollow in HTML head, 3) Any other SEO prevention measures. Add any missing configurations to ensure the example app is not indexed by search engines.
  - Add a search component to the header in the example app (./examples) with real-time search results. Requirements: 1) Search input that looks sexy and matches the app design, 2) Real-time filtering as user types, 3) Search through all pages/routes in the app, 4) Show results in a dropdown (e.g., typing 'bo' shows 'Box' page), 5) Clicking a result navigates to that page, 6) Include keyboard navigation support, 7) Style it to look modern and professional.
  - Change the hardcoded '2024' year in the footer of the example app (./examples) to dynamically show the current year using JavaScript's new Date().getFullYear(). Find all instances of hardcoded 2024 in the footer and replace with dynamic year generation.
- **Fix various styling issues in the example app to improve consistency and user experience** (7 subtasks completed)
  - On the Homepage in the Getting Started section, ensure all code examples use our syntax highlighting component for consistent code presentation
  - Remove the gradient/weird style effect on the /documentation page header. Use standard header styling consistent with other pages like /examples. Apply this to all documentation/* pages
  - Replace the horizontal navigation bar on /documentation with a vertical sidebar navigation (standard for doc sites like https://magicui.design/docs)
  - Fix weird styling on nested documentation pages (documentation/*): remove green headers (use dark theme), remove weird underlines/overlines, fix button gradients (see /documentation/layout-components), fix container styling. Ensure clean, consistent UI matching our home page styles
  - On the /showcase page, apply syntax highlighting to the show/hide JSON feature for each component using our syntax highlighting component
  - On the /examples page, change the floating menu color from purple to violet/blue to maintain consistency (we don't use blue elsewhere)
  - On the /examples page, remove all 'new' and 'stable' badges from components. Everything will be in the initial release


## [2025-05-31]

- **Additional UI/UX fixes for the example app (./examples) to improve usability and consistency** (5 subtasks completed)
  - Remove the 'React Jedi Documentation' hero section on the /documentation page in the example app (./examples). This includes the purple/gradient background section with 'Get Started' and 'View Components' buttons. Keep only the clean documentation content below.
  - Add previous/next navigation buttons at the bottom of each documentation page in the example app (./examples). Style them nicely to match the app design. First page (Getting Started) should only have 'Next' button leading to Component System. Last page should only have 'Previous' button. All other pages should have both. Include page titles in the buttons.
  - Fix the floating navigation bar on the /showcase page in the example app (./examples). The floating nav is hidden behind the fixed header. Add proper top offset/margin to account for the fixed header height so the floating navigation is fully visible and accessible.
  - Investigate why styles from the main library (./src) aren't being applied in the example app (./examples). All buttons appear black instead of styled. Check: 1) Import paths for @alexberriman/react-jedi styles, 2) Build process and dist folder, 3) Vite config for style handling, 4) Console errors, 5) Whether library CSS is being bundled correctly. Fix the root cause to ensure SDUI components render with proper styling.
  - Update the root README.md file. Analyze the entire repository structure and create a simple, sexy, straightforward README with: 1) Clear project description, 2) Table of contents, 3) Installation instructions, 4) Quick start guide, 5) Key features, 6) Examples, 7) Documentation links, 8) Contributing guidelines. Make it professional and appealing for developers discovering the project.


## [2025-05-30]

- **Polish and improve the example app (./examples) user experience, navigation, and overall design quality. Remove redundant pages, fix UI issues, and enhance the documentation and performance pages.** (12 subtasks completed)
  - Fix the header dropdown menu in the example app (./examples) - it's glitchy when you click on parent items with children. Clicking on parent items should have no effect (only hover should trigger show/hide). Also add cursor-pointer styling to interactive elements.
  - Remove the 'Interactive Components Now Available!' container at the bottom of the /showcase page in the example app (./examples).
  - Remove the 'Advanced Layout Components' page (/showcase/layout) from the example app (./examples) since we've added detailed pages for every component. Also remove this link from the header navigation.
  - Remove the '/showcase/overlay-interactive' page ('Interactive Overlay Components') from the example app (./examples) as we've created detailed pages for each component. Also remove this link from the header navigation.
  - Remove the '/showcase/interactive' page ('Interactive Component Showcase') from the example app (./examples). Also remove this link from the header navigation.
  - Redesign the /examples page in the example app (./examples) to look nicer. The current box/card layout doesn't work well with many items. Create a cleaner, more organized layout.
  - Remove the '/examples/form-validation' page from the example app (./examples) and also remove it from the header navigation.
  - Remove the '/examples/landing' page from the example app (./examples) and also remove it from the header navigation.
  - Remove the '/examples/navigation' page from the example app (./examples) and also remove it from the header navigation.
  - Move the Documentation page to the first link in the header menu (before components) in the example app (./examples). Redesign it to look way nicer and more like a traditional documentation page. Add syntax highlighting for JSON/TypeScript code using a 3rd party plugin. Break content into logical sections (Introduction, Getting Started, etc.). Avoid content duplication by linking to existing pages. Make the documentation look professional and sexy.
  - Redesign the /performance page in the example app (./examples) to look way nicer with clean, simple, flat, and sexy UI design.
  - Update the footer menu in the example app (./examples) to be current and reflective of the updated site structure after removing and reorganizing pages.
