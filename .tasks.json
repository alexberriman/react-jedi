    "description": "Implement dual-mode story functionality for TypewriterText component. CRITICAL: The args MUST use type 'TypewriterText' NOT 'component'. The SDUI view should render EXACTLY the same as the React view. Add play() functions that verify actual content renders (animated text, cursor, etc). Test by viewing both React and SDUI tabs in Storybook - they should be identical.",
