Keyboard-navigable menus are not available in SDUI mode. APPROACH: May be able to enhance Command component as it already has keyboard navigation patterns. ACTION REQUIRED: 1) Assess if KeyboardNavigationMenu can be implemented in SDUI. 2) Consider extending Command component for keyboard navigation patterns. 3) Implement arrow key navigation, Enter/Space selection. 4) Support focus management and ARIA attributes. 5) Ensure Tab key navigation works properly.

ISSUE 1 - Hover Styling: On hover, shows white text on grey background making text unreadable, dropdown is all white (https://i.imgur.com/eHkc352.png). ISSUE 2 - Missing Badge: 'With Icons And Badges' story doesn't show badges in SDUI. ISSUE 3 - Alignment: 'With Full Width Content' story is left-aligned in SDUI but should be horizontally centered like React. ISSUE 4 - Missing Elements: 'With Branding And CTA' story missing branding text '**ACME' and CTA buttons in SDUI. ACTION REQUIRED: 1) Fix hover state styling - ensure readable contrast and proper dropdown styling. 2) Implement badge rendering within navigation items. 3) Fix alignment issues - ensure center alignment matches React. 4) Ensure all navigation elements render: branding, buttons, badges, icons. IMPORTANT: Icons must be actual SVG components, NOT emojis. 5) Test responsive behavior and all navigation patterns. EXPECTED OUTCOME: NavigationMenu in SDUI should match React exactly for styling, alignment, and all child elements including proper SVG icons.",

ISSUE 2 - Missing Icons: Icons don't render at all in SDUI mode for resizable panels. IMPORTANT: Emojis are NOT valid icons - SDUI must render actual icon components (SVGs) just like React mode. ACTION REQUIRED: 1) Fix text color inheritance - ensure dark theme styles apply in SDUI. 2) Implement actual SVG icon rendering for resize handles and panel content. 3) Ensure resize functionality works identically in both modes. 4) Test with nested resizable panels and different orientations. 5) Verify drag handles and cursors work properly.
