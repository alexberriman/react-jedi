Same for 'Custom Separator' and 'Password' variants. ISSUE 2 - Default Value: 'With Default Value' story doesn't show the default value in SDUI. ISSUE 3 - Disabled State: 'Disabled' variant isn't actually disabled in SDUI mode. ACTION REQUIRED: 1) Fix maxLength/length prop handling in SDUI to show correct digit count. 2) Ensure defaultValue prop is properly passed and rendered. 3) Implement disabled state handling in SDUI mode. 4) Test all InputOTP configurations thoroughly. 5) Ensure input restrictions (numeric only) work in SDUI. EXPECTED OUTCOME: InputOTP in SDUI should match React behavior for digit count, default values, and disabled state.",

Input fields that should have icons (search, email, etc.) show no icons. ROOT CAUSE: Icon components within Input elements aren't processed by SDUI renderer. IMPORTANT: Emojis are NOT valid icons - SDUI must render actual icon components (SVGs) just like React mode. ACTION REQUIRED: 1) Investigate how icons are integrated into Input component. 2) Update SDUI renderer to handle actual SVG icons within Input. 3) Support both left and right icon positions. 4) Ensure icon sizing and alignment match React mode. 5) Test with various icon types and input variants. 6) Maintain proper padding to accommodate icons. EXPECTED OUTCOME: Input components in SDUI should display actual SVG icons exactly as they appear in React mode.",

    "description": "TASK: Implement comprehensive icon rendering system for SDUI/JSON mode. CRITICAL ISSUE: System-wide problem - many components fall back to emojis instead of rendering proper icons in SDUI mode. This affects Alert, Badge, Breadcrumb, Button, Command, DataTable, NavigationMenu, Resizable, Tabs, Input, ToggleGroup, and potentially others. ROOT CAUSE: The SDUI rendering system cannot process icon components from the JSON specification. IMPACT: Major usability and professional appearance issues across the entire component library. IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION: Emojis (🚀, ⚠️, ✓, etc.) are NOT valid icons. SDUI components MUST be able to render actual SVG icon components just like React mode does. Icons should be proper vector graphics, not emoji characters. ACTION REQUIRED: 1) Design icon component architecture for SDUI (icon library mapping, icon registry, or inline SVG support). 2) Implement icon renderer that can handle common icon libraries (Lucide, Heroicons, etc.). 3) Create icon mapping system to translate icon names/components to renderable SVG elements. 4) Update all affected components to use the new icon system. 5) Remove ALL emoji fallback code throughout the codebase - emojis are NOT acceptable substitutes for icons. 6) Support icon props: size, color, strokeWidth, className. 7) Document the icon system for SDUI usage. 8) Add comprehensive tests for icon rendering. EXPECTED OUTCOME: Full SVG icon support in SDUI mode matching React exactly, with NO emoji fallbacks anywhere in the system. All icons must be proper vector graphics.",
