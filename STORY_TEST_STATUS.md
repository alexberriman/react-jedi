# Storybook Test Status Report

## Current Issues

### 1. Vitest + Storybook Test Addon Compatibility

- **Error**: `browserType.connect: WebSocket error: connect ECONNREFUSED`
- **Status**: Playwright chromium browser is installed but connection fails

## Recommendations

### Immediate Solutions
1. **Downgrade Node.js**: Use Node 20.x LTS instead of Node 24.x for compatibility
2. **Alternative Test Runner**: Use standard Vitest tests instead of Storybook integration tests
3. **Manual Testing**: Use Storybook's interactive UI to manually test play functions

### Long-term Solutions
1. **Wait for Updates**: Monitor Vitest and Storybook for Node 24 compatibility updates
2. **Create Custom Test Setup**: Build a custom test runner that doesn't rely on the problematic integration
3. **Migrate to Different Test Strategy**: Consider using Playwright directly for component testing

## Working Tests
The following test suites are confirmed working:
- Unit tests (`npm run test:unit`)
- Component tests (`npm run test:all`)
- Individual test files run successfully with standard Vitest

## Files Modified
- `vitest.config.ts` - Updated storybookScript from yarn to npm
- `package.json` - Updated test:stories script to remove glob pattern

## Conclusion
The Storybook interaction tests are well-written and comprehensive but cannot currently run due to tooling compatibility issues with Node 24. The tests themselves appear to be correct and would likely pass if the runtime issues were resolved.
