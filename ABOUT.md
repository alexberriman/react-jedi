# ABOUT

## Introduction

Welcome to **@banja/react-jedi**â€”a cutting-edge npm library designed to rapidly build, prototype, and deploy stunningly beautiful, modern React interfaces. Leveraging a Server-Driven UI (SDUI) approach combined with React, TailwindCSS, and ShadCN components, React Jedi empowers teams to deliver visually striking, high-quality websites tailored to diverse branding and style guides efficiently and consistently.

----------

## What is React Jedi?

React Jedi is **not an application or framework**, but a specialized **npm library** (`@banja/react-jedi`) crafted specifically for rapid website prototyping and development as part of high-impact lead generation campaigns. As a modular, importable package, it integrates seamlessly into any React application, providing a comprehensive suite of tools for JSON-driven UI rendering.

### Key Package Features

## SDUI on Steroids

At its core, @banja/react-jedi is an SDUI (Server-Driven UI) library that takes the concept to unprecedented levels. Unlike traditional SDUI implementations that offer basic component rendering, React Jedi provides:

- **Dynamic JSON-Driven Rendering**: Define entire UIs, from simple components to complex page layouts, using pure JSON specifications
- **Single Function API**: A streamlined `render()` function that takes an options object with a `specification` property containing your UI definition
- **Real-Time UI Generation**: Generate beautiful interfaces on-the-fly with zero development overhead
- **Nested Component Architecture**: Build complex UIs by composing components within components, all defined in JSON
- **Reactive State Management**: Declaratively manage component state, interactions, and side-effects directly in your specifications
- **Conditional Rendering Logic**: Implement sophisticated conditional rendering directly in your JSON schema
- **Event Handling Framework**: Define event handlers and callback functions within your specifications
- **Layout System**: Powerful grid and flexbox layout controls through simple JSON properties
- **Animation Framework**: Define entrance, exit, and interaction animations declaratively 
- **Theme Inheritance**: Cascading theme properties that flow through your component hierarchy

## Library Usage

As a standalone npm package, @banja/react-jedi is designed to be integrated into existing React applications:

```jsx
// Import the library
import { render } from '@banja/react-jedi';

// Use it in your React components
function MyPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      {render({
        specification: {
          type: "Hero",
          props: {
            title: "Welcome to My Website",
            subtitle: "Built with React Jedi"
          },
          styles: {
            container: "bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-600"
          }
        }
      })}
    </div>
  );
}
```

This simple import pattern allows React Jedi to be used alongside your existing components and state management solutions.

## Specification Structure

A @banja/react-jedi specification is a JSON object that follows this general structure:

```json
{
  "type": "componentName",
  "props": {
    "property1": "value1",
    "property2": "value2"
  },
  "children": [
    {
      "type": "childComponent",
      "props": { ... }
    }
  ],
  "styles": {
    "container": "classes for container",
    "item": "classes for items"
  },
  "layout": {
    "grid": "cols-1 md:cols-2 lg:cols-3",
    "gap": "gap-4"
  },
  "state": {
    "count": {
      "initial": 0,
      "actions": {
        "increment": "count + 1",
        "decrement": "count - 1"
      }
    }
  },
  "events": {
    "onClick": {
      "action": "increment"
    }
  },
  "conditions": {
    "showComponent": "count > 0"
  },
  "animations": {
    "enter": "fade-in",
    "exit": "fade-out"
  }
}
```

This powerful specification format enables complete control over component rendering, styling, behavior, and interactions without writing a single line of React code.
