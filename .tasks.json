    "description": "TASK: Fix Table component styling inconsistencies in SDUI mode. ISSUE 1 - Striped: 'Striped' variant doesn't show alternating row colors in SDUI. ISSUE 2 - Bordered: Missing borders and incorrect header background in SDUI. ISSUE 3 - Spacing: 'Minimal' and 'Compact' variants have too much spacing in SDUI (React spacing is correct).

ACTION REQUIRED: 1) Ensure stripe styles are applied in SDUI mode. 2) Fix border and header background styles. 3) Correct spacing for compact variants. 4) Match modern variant styling to React. 5) Remove hover effects where not intended. 6) Test all table variants thoroughly.
